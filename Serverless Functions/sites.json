Bank robbing is illegal, but not one gets excited if Donald Trump were to say bank robbers should be punished. The real issue is why is abortion illegal???

Almost everyone had to use a derogatory remark to the person they were responding to.

I first got interested in politics when Kennedy and Nixon ran. What an amazing election that one was. I have been a Democrat, Independent and Republican. I have held political office. I really have reached the point where I no longer like or trust any Democrat or Republican who have chosen to make politics a career. Worst thing we have allowed to happen. Term limits were placed on the office of the President for a reason. The same reason should apply to all offices from the smallest town board to the White House. Reason?? Human beings are imperfect and their imperfections create the problems we have. We cannot live together peacefully. We are more easily motivated through anger than peace and love. We are not the only country that desires to make the rest of the world live as we do. Every type of government out there has the same desire. Every type of government feels it is the end all be all answer. Hence the competition world wide. Now a group from all over the world have come up with what they think is a solution. One world order. Everyone lives the same, does the same, and is the same. Imagine that!! What if everyone in your neighborhood had the same house, same income, ate the same meals, wore the same clothes, made exactly the same money. Is that what appeals to people??", "I am not saying this is the truth because I have no proof. However since Trump is getting a lot of unpaid publicity from things like this and based on the stated amounts of what people were paid it could be well within the realms of possibility that they were paid by neither Clinton supporters nor Sanders supporters but by a camp much closer to \u201chome.\u201d I do not hate Trump. I don\u2019t believe he is what america needs however. We the people have been told for years that we need to just work hard get good jobs and we can get ahead. But I don\u2019t see that happening. For one thing there are limited numbers of those so-called good jobs, then there is an increasing gap between those that have the good jobs and those that have minimum wage jobs.When Minimum wage was instituted the idea was that a man could work for 40 hours on said job support a wife and raise a family. Today we hear of people working 3 part time jobs (because the stores/etc refuse to hire for full time for 60-80 hours + and still having difficulty making ends meet for their families. It is easy to say just go get a job but the reality is that most if not all jobs have been slowly if not rapidly trickling out of the country to places like India, China, and even Mexico where the company needs not pay its workers even the minimum wage.My dad put 22 years in the service (Navy) and we still had struggles growing up with them raising 4 kids. Now I won\u2019t say we were poor because we weren\u2019t but we wore hand-me-down clothing and for a good part of the time when we got \u201cnew\u201d clothes it was a donation from the parent of a classmate or it was from goodwill or some other thrift shop.My dad paid into a type of military insurance while he was in the service but even though he retired his death was found service connected. My mom was given a choice either take the VA benefits or take the insurance benefits and the VA ones were higher so that was the choice she made. Which means my dad and family was effectively robbed of the benefits he paid for. Yet I think he might have willingly paid for them anyway because what if his death had not been found service connected?Anyway back to the article. Who benefits most from the protesting? Well Horner is correct that if it can be implied or inferred it is Sanders supporters then this would be good propaganda for the Clinton campaign. However consider this Trump is a businessman and from things I have read he has had 4 failed businesses but he still seems to float up to the top at least appearance wise, so he is used to manipulating the media and propaganda to make himself look good. He thinks people are whiners and babies and people living in their parents house and that they are already being paid too much. the differences in the pay rates also seem to reflect much of his beliefs as well as to the value of the people hired. I too am college educated though I can\u2019t say it helped me overly much to get a job. However I know that Trump is a shrewd business man in the sense that he knows how to work the angles. I however based on things he has said and the violence he seems to be provoking think that should he manage to be voted into power he would work to amend the constitution in such a way that the right to protest would be a thing of the past. And while all those that support him like the idea of building walls to keep people out do keep in mind that those same walls can keep people in as well.", "\u201cWhen Minimum wage was instituted the idea was that a man could work for 40 hours on said job support a wife and raise a family.\u201d", "Minimum wage was never meant to be a living wage. It was instituted so that businesses could not take advantage and pay next to nothing wages to young people out of school who wanted a summer job.

But this is the truth. I would pay as much as I had to protest a Trump rally and I know of thousands of other people who would happily do the same. The guy is a disgrace to our country.

One such document entitled, \u00e20\u009cnging Real Muscle To Bear In Syria,\u00e20\u009ditten by CIA officer Graham Fuller, is particularly illuminating. In this document, Fuller wrote,", "Syria at present has a hammerlock on US interests both in Lebanon and in the Gulf \u2014 through closure of Iraq\u2019s pipeline thereby threatening Iraqi internationalization of the [Iran-Iraq] war. The US should consider sharply escalating the pressures against Assad [Sr.] through covertly orchestrating simultaneous military threats against Syria from three border states hostile to Syria: Iraq, Israel and Turkey.", "Even as far back as 1983, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u00e20\u0099ather, Hafez Assad, was viewed as a gadfly to the plans of Western imperialists seeking to weaken both the Iraqis and the Iranians and extend hegemony over the Middle East and Persia. The document shows that Assad and hence Syria represented a resistance to Western imperialism, a threat to Israel, and that Assad himself was well aware of the game the United States, Israel, and other members of the Western imperialist coalition were trying to play against him. The report reads,", "Syria continues to maintain a hammerlock on two key U.S. interests in the Middle East:", "\u2014 Syrian refusal to withdraw its troops from Lebanon ensures Israeli occupation in the south;", "\u2014 Syrian closure of the Iraqi pipeline has been a key factor in bringing Iraq to its financial knees, impelling it towards dangerous internationalization of the war in the Gulf", "Diplomatic initiatives to date have had little effect on Assad who has so far correctly calculated the play of forces in the area and concluded that they are only weakly arrayed against him. If the U.S. is to rein in Syria\u00e20\u0099poiling role, it can only do so through exertion of real muscle which will pose a vital threat to Assad\u00e20\u0099osition and power.", "The author then presents a plan that sounds eerily similar to those now being discussed publicly by Western and specifically American corporate-financier think tanks and private non-governmental organizations who unofficially craft American policy. Fuller writes,", "The US should consider sharply escalating the pressures against Assad [Sr.] through covertly orchestrating simultaneous military threats against Syria from three border states hostile to Syria: Iraq, Israel and Turkey. Iraq, perceived to be increasingly desperate in the Gulf war, would undertake limited military (air) operations against Syria with the sole goal of opening the pipeline. Although opening war on a second front against Syria poses considerable risk to Iraq, Syria would also face a two-front war since it is already heavily engaged in the Bekaa, on the Golan and in maintaining control over a hostile and restive population inside Syria.", "Israel would simultaneously raise tensions along Syria\u00e20\u0099ebanon front without actually going to war. Turkey, angered by Syrian support to Armenian terrorism, to Iraqi Kurds on Turkey\u00e20\u0099urdish border areas and to Turkish terrorists operating out of northern Syria, has often considered launching unilateral military operations against terrorist camps in northern Syria. Virtually all Arab states would have sympathy for Iraq.", "Faced with three belligerent fronts, Assad would probably be forced to abandon his policy of closure of the pipeline. Such a concession would relieve the economic pressure on Iraq, and perhaps force Iran to reconsider bringing the war to an end. It would be a sharpening blow to Syria\u00e20\u0099restige and could effect the equation of forces in Lebanon.", "Thus, Fuller outlines that not only would Syria be forced to reopen the pipeline of interest at the time, but that it would be a regional shockwave effecting the makeup of forces in and around Lebanon, weakening the prestige of the Syrian state and, presumably, the psychological state of the Syrian President and the Syrian people, as well as a message to Iran.", "The document continues,", "Such a threat must be primarily military in nature. At present there are three relatively hostile elements around Syria\u00e20\u0099orders: Israel, Iraq and Turkey. Consideration must be given to orchestrating a credible military threat against Syria in order to induce at least some moderate change in its policies.", "This paper proposes serious examination of the use of all three states \u00e20\u0093ting independently \u00e20\u0093 exert the necessary threat. Use of any one state in isolation cannot create such a credible threat.", "Turkey\u00e20\u0099articipation would be vital for success, and Washington would have to encourage the Turks to play a more helpful role than they have so far. While Ankara has lost all patience with Damascus, it has taken few concrete steps that would increase the pressure on Asad (and thereby antagonize Tehran). Turkish policy toward the Syrian opposition has actually worked at cross-purposes with American efforts to foster a broad, unified national organization. With an eye to its own domestic Kurdish dilemmas, Ankara has frustrated efforts to integrate the Syrian Kurds into a broader opposition framework. In addition, it has overtly favored the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood over all other opposition groups. Washington must impress upon Turkey the need to be more accommodating of legitimate Kurdish political and cultural demands in a post-Asad Syria, and to be less insistent on the primacy of the Muslim Brotherhood.", "Some voices in Washington and Jerusalem are exploring whether Israel could contribute to coercing Syrian elites to remove Asad. The Israelis have the region\u00e20\u0099ost formidable military, impressive intelligence services, and keen interests in Syria. In addition, Israel\u00e20\u0099ntelligence services have a strong knowledge of Syria, as well as assets within the Syrian regime that could be used to subvert the regime\u00e20\u0099ower base and press for Asad\u00e20\u0099emoval. Israel could posture forces on or near the Golan Heights and, in so doing, might divert regime forces from suppressing the opposition. This posture may conjure fears in the Asad regime of a multi-front war, particularly if Turkey is willing to do the same on its border and if the Syrian opposition is being fed a steady diet of arms and training. Such a mobilization could perhaps persuade Syria\u00e20\u0099ilitary leadership to oust Asad in order to preserve itself. Advocates argue this additional pressure could tip the balance against Asad inside Syria, if other forces were aligned properly.", "While Syria is not in conflict with Iraq today, after being destroyed by the United States in 2003, Western Iraq now houses the mysteriously-funded Islamic State on the border between Iraq and Syria.", "That being said, this plan is not merely being discussed, it is being implemented as one can clearly see by the fact that Israel routinely launches airstrikes against the Syrian military, Turkey continues to funnel ISIS and related terrorists into Syria through its own territory, and ISIS continues to present itself as an Eastern front militarily. As a result, the \u00e20\u009cti-front\u00e20\u009dr envisioned and written about by the CIA in 1983 and discussed by Brookings in 2012 has come to fruition and is in full swing today.", "The trail of documentation and the manner in which the overarching agenda of world hegemony on the behalf of corporate-financier interests have continued apace regardless of party and seamlessly through Republican and Democrat administrations serves to prove that changing parties and personalities do nothing to stop the onslaught of imperialism, war, and destruction being waged across the world today and in earnest ever since 2001. Indeed, such changes only make adjustments to the appearance and presentation of a much larger Communo-Fascist system that is entrenching itself by the day.", "Hey, Brandon: Trump\u2019s administration will NEVER \u201clook like obama\u2019s administration\u201d you damn turncoat!

This is empirically, scientifically observed in the animal world, for example and in human behavioral studies ie.. the most famous of academic studies THE KINSEY REPORT, among many others too many to list here.. . And to clarify, its not a WESTERN agenda, From a socio historical anthropological context many African tribal cultures, Uganda\u2019s being foremost, commonly acknowledged, accepted homosexuality as just a variance of human sexuality. It was accepted culturally as \u201canother way of being\u201d. It wasn\u2019t until the arrival of WHITE CHRISTIAN COLONIZERS when that cultural attitude shifted. The WHITE CHRISTIAN COLONIZERS discouraged the \u201cother way of being\u201d because it failed to conform to their rigid moralistic values. Basically, The WHITE COLONIZERS displaced the local tribal value system with their own rigid system of PUNITIVE CONFORMITY TO WHITE STANDARDS. When President Museveni claims to be the vanguard of Ugandan culture, he is merely parroting years of colonized and whitewashed Ugandan history. Tribal African traditions allowed same sex couplings. The Ugandan King Mwanga II was openly homosexual and battled Christian missionaries who opposed him for that reason. In Christian martyrdom myths , King Mwanga is often portrayed as predatory and malevolent. However, his legend lives on tribal oral storytelling traditions. \u201cCross Cultural Codes on 20 Sexual Attitudes and Practices\u201d was an anthropological study published in 1976, a seminal work, written by anthropologists Stephen Murray and Will Roscoe, refutes the idea that homosexuality was nonexistent in African culture and merely an invention of the WEST.

Its amazing that people still cling to archaic and irrational notions regarding the human variance in sexual orientation.", "c_dynes", "In cases of twin studies, orientation may be influenced by a confluence of factors, including hormonal fluctuations in vitro, etc.. which may account for one twin being gay and the other not..

No sane and self-respecting academic any longer relies on such studies that were conducted by persons who had no idea whatsoever that they were, in most part, dealing with societies that had a deeper understanding of the need to live in harmony with nature and who had, in earlier civilization, given the western world algebra, astronomy and indeed, religion. For who, if seriously seeking the truth, does not know that Jesus Christ was not Caucasian and that the origins of Christianity are in fact African?That aside, I will put it in simple terms. Properly conducted research has shown that genetically-identical twins do not both turn out to be homosexual when one of them is. What this means is that homosexuality is not a natural phenomenon but an acquired social trait that can be discarded if one has the moral gumption and conviction to discern it for what it truly is.You do not tell the truth when you sate that the practice was rampant in Africa before the arrival of the missionaries. Implicit in that assertion is an unacceptable racist intonation that Africans had no moral values and needed to be set off from some atavistic depravity by the missionaries. In this day and age such thoughts are disturbing and offend the accepted notions of the equality of persons of every hue and colour.This thing about human variance in sexual orientation is an embarrassingly convenient justification for unnatural behaviour and a cheap exercise in intellectual dishonesty in the face of hard scientific facts .Personally, I have nothing against gay persons for as long as they do not seek to impose it upon those who regard it as unnatural and undesirable.If the west is comfortable with the practice, good, but please, keep it away from the shores of Africa, It is already bad enough with South Africa, that unfortunate country, whose peoples were subjugated longer than any in history, having been corralled into adopting the practice as a constitutional necessity.

While marijuana is not itself a hard drug, it DOES lead to impaired driving, perhaps not as strongly as alcohol, but a recent review in the British Medical Journal found people who used marijuana within three hours of driving were nearly twice as likely to cause a crash as a sober driver. It is also \u2013 in spite of the multitude of vociferous lies put forth on this subject \u2013 a gateway to harder drugs. I will state that every one of the people I\u2019ve known who screwed their lives up with drugs (and I\u2019m sorry to say I\u2019ve known a number of them) had started out with marijuana. EVERY ONE. Also, pot smoking, like ALL smoking, is carcinogenic. The estimation is that one joint equals about three cigarettes in carcinogenic properties.", "Nevertheless, if pot has to be legalized, then I would very much want to see the large tobacco companies like Phillip Morris and others get into the trade. Such companies are well-placed to quickly dominate the business and put all the tie-dyed \u201cWoodstock Nation\u201d liberal-led head shop owners on the unemployment line. Smart hard-working conservative corporations \u2013 including the tobacco companies \u2013 are much more able to capitalize on an industry. I would never trust loser pot heads to run ANYTHING right.", "When big tobacco enter this industry, it will put the Lefties in a huge quandary, because while they love their grass, they HATE the tobacco companies, which they see as the so-called \u201cestablishment\u201d, and they will never want to support them (If you think I\u2019m wrong, just look at some of the amusing comments on this board!). That\u2019s why for years we\u2019ve been hearing from the liberals about all the ill effects of cigar and cigarette smoking, but very little if anything about the ill effects of pot smoking.

Indeed, I would not at all be surprised to learn that big tobacco has already been secretly pushing to get pot legalized in Colorado and other states. After all, their business has been hit hard over the past decades by the anti-smoking crowd. It stands to reason that they will want to seek out new markets.Once big tobacco gets into the legal marijuana industry, liberals will be screaming to the high heavens that pot, like tobacco, is carcinogenic too, as well as a gateway to other drugs. And they will soon wind up fighting against their own beloved weed that they fought so hard for all these years. The reason for this, I believe, is because it\u2019s not so much marijuana itself that the Lefties love. Rather, it\u2019s the fact that they are doing something against the so-called establishment that makes it appealing to them. They get all the satisfaction that an unruly teenager gets when he defies Mommy and Daddy. That\u2019s because the liberal mind at ANY age is stuck in an adolescent mode. The little one has to be defiant, he has to prove his independence. And what better way to do that then to use a drug that the conservative establishment frowns upon?

My wife started sleeping with other men outside. Sometimes i will return from work without finding my wife at home and whenever i call or ask her where she was, she will always snub at me and sometimes just tell me to go get a larger dick. All this continued for a long time and it hurt me so much that i was at the edge of breaking up on the marriage till when i read about a doctor called DR. OYAMA online. I never thought i could smile and be in a happy marriage again if not for the help of DR.OYAMA. I got the doctors Emails: [email protected]. on the internet and i emailed him, and he got back to me with some encouraging words, he got me some herbs which i use for just 8 days and i began to feel the enlargement of my penis, and without surgery.

Back when the war was getting started, both Clinton and Hague were busy front-running their \u201cFriends of Syria\u201d whistle stop tour around the Middle East and Europe, securing Gulf cash commitments while grooming their hand-picked \u2018opposition\u2019 government in exile, holding court in various 5 star hotels in Paris, London and Istanbul. The US had tried this only a year earlier with Libya, and at the time in 2011-2012, they had every reason to believe that the Libyan formula could be repeated in Syria. Those hopes were dashed by early\u00c202013, when it became apparent that Libya was officially a failed state. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of extremist foreign fighters and jihadi soldiers of fortune began pouring into Syria. It was an invasion. This was the West\u2019s proxy army, ready to decapitate the government, dismember the state and destabilize the region \u2013 with the full blessing of Washington DC and its partners.", "The Troika of Washington-London-Paris then doubled down by pouring billions of dollars in lethal weapons to various fighting groups laying in waiting\u00c20in Turkey and Jordan, as well as those already\u00c20active in Syria. There were a number of well-documented arrangements, but one of the most successful working models was for the CIA and its European NATO partners illegally\u00c20supplying the weapons\u00c20funnelled through Jordan and Turkey \u2013 and all paid for by Saudi, Qatari cash. All the while, the public were told by the US-led Coalition all of this was for the \u201cmoderate rebels\u201d in Syria. These were meant to be the \u201cfreedom fighters\u201d that Ronald Reagan referred to back in the 1980\u2019s.

In the summer of 2014, an added bonus for the US was inserted into the mix \u2013 the emergence of ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Sham). The appearance of ISIS allowed the US to fly air sorties over Syria, allegedly to fight ISIS, although after 3 years the US has produced\u00c20little if any verifiable progress in \u2018defeating\u2019 ISIS. In truth, the US had hoped that ISIS, along with the other al Qaeda affiliates, would somehow do the job of destabilizing Syria and overthrowing the government of President Bashar al Assad in Damascus.

The White Helmets is clearly a public relations project which has received glowing publicity from HuffPo to Nicholas Kristof at the NYT.

They were followed by extensive investigations by Vanessa Beeley who has since produced a formidable\u00c20volume of research and analysis\u00c20on the White Helmets and other similar NGO projects, all of which are readily available\u00c20on 21st Century Wire.", "Any researcher working on a White Helmets documentary would have had access to all of this information, through a simple key word search.", "Interestingly, mainstream media defenders of the White Helmets such as Michael Weiss, a senior fellow at NATO\u2019s own propaganda think tank the Atlantic Council, as well as editor at the dubious\u00c20Daily Beast, claim that\u00c20criticism of the White Helmets is a Russian plot organized by Putin himself. Weiss\u2019 conspiracy theory is expected considering his employer\u2019s affiliation, but such typical\u00c20hyperbolic accusations belie the fact that the first individuals\u00c20to expose this pseudo NGO are not Russian, but rather independent writers and researchers from the US, Canada\u00c20and Great Britain and why not \u2013\u00c20because it\u2019s their tax dollars that is\u00c20funding the White Helmets. It\u2019s also worth noting\u00c20that in December 2016 when the Nusra terrorist hold over East Aleppo was collapsing, it was Michael Weiss\u00c20who is responsible for circulating\u00c20bogus reports, including that women in East Aleppo were committing \u2018mass suicide\u2019 to avoid \u2018mass rape\u2019 by Assad\u2019s soldiers.\u00c20\u201cSeventy-nine of them were executed at the barricades.

This was just one of many fake news stories disseminated in\u00c20the mainstream media. Weiss then went on to repeat the fabricated story to a global mainstream audience on CNN\u2019s Don Lemon Show.", "In reality, and according to countless first-hand on the ground eye witness testimonies collected by 21WIRE and other media outlets, as the Syrian Army began\u00c20liberating East Aleppo, the so-called\u00c20\u2018moderate rebels\u2019 promoted by Weiss and other western media operatives were using residents as human shields, and in some cases shooting residents who attempted to flee terrorist enclaves prior to government forces liberating the eastern half of the city.", "With direct funding to the White Helmets from US-led Coalition\u00c20countries already well in excess\u00c20$150 million \u2013 international stakeholders expect\u00c20a return on their investment. That return comes in the form of dramatic \u2018search and rescue\u2019 videos, some of which may have even been produced in Turkey, and which were then sent in \u00c20a highly coordinated fashion to the editorial desks of CNN, NBC, BBC, Al Jazeera, Al Arabiya, New York Times, Washington Post, The Guardian and others. At no time have any of these western or GCC-based \u2018journalists\u2019 ever queried the authenticity of the staged video and photographic productions supplied by the White Helmets. Mainly, their videos have been produced to promote\u00c20a No Fly Zone, or \u2018Safe Zones\u2019 in Syria by creating the false impression that somehow Syrian and Russian air forces are targeting civilians in a\u00c20Blitzkrieg\u00c20fashion, using crude \u201cbarrel bombs\u201d. Outside of the White Helmets propaganda, there is scant evidence of these \u2018barrel bombs\u2019 supposedly dropped by the \u2018Assad Regime\u2019 every day according to the White Helmets.", "In the run-up to the White Helmets\u2019 failed Nobel Peace Prize bid in October, CNN even went so far as to plant a fake story about a barrel bomb hitting a \u201cWhite Helmets Center\u201d in Damascus. Increasing attention has also meant that some people are\u00c20beginning\u00c20to question the group\u2019s incredible claim at the time that it had somehow saved 60,000 lives since it started in late 2013. In one\u00c20letter first published at\u00c20Canadian Dimension,\u00c20retired academic\u00c20John Ryan, PhD, a retired professor of geography and senior scholar at the University of Winnipeg, challenged this narrative,\u00c20saying:", "\u201cIt is the White Helmets themselves who have claimed that they have rescued 60,000 civilians; this has not been verified by any other source. Despite such a classic conflict of interest, searching for independent evidence and disqualifying self-serving claims from belligerent parties in Syria has been ignored in much of the western media. As such, this claim by the White Helmets without any verification is next to meaningless.\u201d", "Despite the questions, the group continued to raise this figure by about 10,000 every two months. They now claim to have \u201cSaved over 82,000\u00c20lives\u201d since they were formed in 2013. Where are the list of names, dates, times, locations and medical reports \u2013 so as to corroborate and cross-reference the casualties with the alleged Syrian and Russian airstrikes? What\u2019s the problem \u2013 can\u2019t $150 million buy a little bit of administration for the White Helmets? At no point have they ever been able to produce any data to back up there outlandish numbers claims \u2013 so we can only conclude that this claim, like so many other claims by the group, are fraudulent. But when has Hollywood ever let facts and data get in the way of a good war propaganda story?", "In addition, the White Helmets\u00c20claim that they have trained some 3,000 \u2018volunteers\u2019 throughout Syria, and yet their training facility is actually located in neighboring NATO member state Turkey, on the outskirts of\u00c20the city of Gaziantep. This is the same\u00c20Gaziantep that\u2019s been described in reports\u00c20as \u201cthe\u00c20home to ISIS\u00c20killers, sex traders\u00e20\u00a6", "\u2018CIVIL DEFENSE\u2019 FRAUD", "Vanessa Beeley\u2019s investigation eventually took her to Syria, where she was able to track down the REAL Syria Civil Defense organization. The US and UK creation of the \u201cWhite Helmets\u201d required that they steal the name \u201cSyria Civil Defense\u201d from a real existing civil defense group based in Syria. Unlike the fraudulent western construct, the REAL Syria Civil Defense was founded 63 years ago and is a registered member of the International Civil Defense Organization (ICDO) based in Geneva.\u00c20For the REAL Syria Civil Defence you dial\u00c20\u201c113\u201d inside Syria. The White Helmets have no such number because they are not a real \u2018search and rescue\u2019 organization. Their whole existence is a fraudulent construct. Beeley\u00c20spoke at length to the REAL Syria Civil Defense and what the crew told her\u00c20was shocking. During the \u2018rebel\u2019 (terrorist) invasion in 2012 of East Aleppo, future members of the White Helmets arrived accompanied by armed terrorists to attack\u00c20the real Syria Civil Defense headquarters. They stole equipment, killed and kidnapped real civil defense volunteers\u00c20as part of their operation to loot and destroy the existing institution.", "Real civil defense workers also detailed how terrorist \u2018Hell Cannon\u2018 attacks had besieged the Old City of Aleppo, which lies right on the\u00c20border\u00c20with the Al Nusra front lines and was\u00c20a regular target for the \u2018rebels\u2019 continuous indiscriminate attacks against residents. Resident testimonies have echoed the same story: while Hell Cannons terrorized the civilians of Aleppo, the White Helmets did nothing \u2013 probably because they were\u00c20with the terrorists who were launching these attacks. Terrorist Hell Cannons use an assortment of containers \u00e20\u0093s canisters, water heater tanks packed full of explosives, glass, metal and any other limb-shredding materials \u2013 these were fired indiscriminately into civilian neighborhoods throughout\u00c20Aleppo. These crude artillery guns also\u00c20just happen to have the exact destructive footprint\u00c20as the alleged \u201cbarrel bombs\u201d which the White Helmets and western media are repeatedly\u00c20saying\u00c20are being fired by\u00c20the \u201cThe Regime\u201d (Assad) against civilians. \u00c20If the White Helmets are to be believed, Assad\u2019s Barrel Bombs have an impact the equivalent of 7.6 on the Richter scale. This outrageous claim was actually made by White Helmets founder James Le\u00c20Mesurier on CNN. In fact,\u00c207.6 on the Richter scale is the equivalent of a hydrogen bomb, we begin to get a picture of the scale of the lies which the western narrative has spinning and which they have come to reply on in order to prosecute this dirty war. Preserving this and other key pieces of fiction is central to the US, UK and George Soros funded public relations management of the White Helmets \u2013 and essential to their entire Syria narrative which has been described by American writer Rick Sterling as something akin to a \u201cFeel Good Hoax.\u201d", "Forget about actual \u2018search and rescue\u2019. That\u2019s not the primary function of this \u2018NGO\u2019. If you need to know one thing about the White Helmets it\u2019s this: marketing. A central part of the marketing campaign is images of men with beards looking up at the sky \u2013 presumably waiting for the next barrel bomb, or the media\u2019s favorite term \u2013 the \u201cdouble tap\u201d (apparently, this is when a sinister\u00c20Assad or Putin pilot returns immediately after an airstrike just to have another crack at\u00c20the White Helmets).ALWAYS LOOKING UP: \u2018Waiting for the next barrel bomb.\u2019", "In most of their videos, you will also see a large number of bearded men in jeans and T-shirts just standing around on the sidelines, always watching the camera, or looking busy \u2013 as if they are cognisant that filming is taking place. When we showed some of these videos to real first responders we were normally met with shoulder shrugs and cynical laughs. People who actually work in this trade will tell you that filming on a first responder call\u00c20is a luxury no worker really has \u2013 aside from maybe a GoPro helmet cam. It\u2019s just\u00c20not something anyone in their right mind would think about very much if there were really people in need of assistance\u00c20\u2013 and yet, this is all the White Helmets do, all day, every day. They film and produce well-edited emotive videos. Another aspect real first responders will point out to us is that most of the time, the White Helmets often look like they don\u2019t know what they are doing \u2013 indicating either a lack of training or\u00c20experience \u2013 which seems to at least contradict their lofty claims of rescuing 82,000 people \u00c20in three and half years \u2013 certainly that would provide\u00c20more experience for 2,900 \u2018volunteers\u2019 than any other search and rescue worker on the planet. In other words, the White Helmets mythology and pantomime is not very credible to any serious observer. But it seems to be good enough for a Netflix audience, and sadly,\u00c20good enough for the Academy, too.", "AWARD-WINNER: \u201cWe got the shot! No need for any first aid spinal procedure here.\u201d", "STAGED: Many of the White Helmets\u2019 child \u2018rescue\u2019 images\u00c20are simply ridiculous.\u00c20", "The other mandatory feature in the White Helmets marketing imagery where men with beards are running to or from a\u00c20scene, they\u2019re always carrying children over their shoulder. Again, when we showed many of these images to actual rescue workers, we were met with puzzled looks. Firstly, why does 99% of the White Helmets marketing imagery only feature small children? Are there not any adults out of the \u201c82,000 saved\u201d to be rescued from the rubble? The White Helmets claim they were only operational in early 2014, so that\u2019s an average of 75\u00c20persons per day, everyday. Considering the amount of people they claim to have trained, spread out over Syria, and where actual air sorties have been\u00c20flown \u2013 it seems like a\u00c20near mathematical impossibility. As the White Helmets provide no incident data for the alleged 82,00 persons saved, there is no way to validate there sensational narrative. Also, you will rarely, if ever see the $150 million British-trained rescue crew ever use a spinal injury backboard \u2013 opting instead to just yank the children by the arm and throw them over the shoulder. When we showed\u00c20these images to real first-responder workers, they were deemed not credible. So it\u2019s safe to conclude that the White Helmets only care about one thing: pictures and videos \u2013 wired via satellite to CNN, the New York Times, or the BBC\u2019s news desk.", "SMART POWER & THE NGO COMPLEX", "Still, despite the group\u2019s obvious links to the US and UK governments, and to known extremists and terrorists \u2013 the western media continues to entertain this NGO as if it were a legitimate \u2018Civil Defense\u2019 organization.

The fact they didn\u2019t might be proof that the intention on their film was not to make a legitimate documentary, but rather to glorify to US-led narrative of the \u2018moderate opposition\u2019.

Only this can bring an end to the war and allow refugees to return to Syria said both Gabbard and Kurdi. This plea is real and reflects the facts on the ground, as opposed to the fake narrative constructed by Natasegara and\u00c20Von Einsiedel, which carefully whitewashes all clandestine involvement by US, UK and its partners (who created and are funding the White Helmets) which has aided in the systematic destruction of\u00c20Syria over the last 6 years, not to mention the needless deaths of hundreds of thousands. It is no coincidence that many members \u00c20of the White Helmets have extremist ties, and the fact that this is being covered-up by Natasegara and\u00c20Von Einsiedel who are literally portraying the group as \u201csaints\u201d \u2013 speaks to the level of deception involved in this story. Now we can see\u00c20Natasegara\u2019s modus operandi with making the White Helmets film; it\u2019s not so much about documenting history in the conventional sense, so much as it is about \u2018making an impact\u2019 politically \u2013 on behalf of the governments who created the White Helmets, which veers into the area of propaganda again.", "Watch Joanna Natasegara in an interview here from\u00c20the 2016 IACC Conference:", ".On the surface,\u00c20Natasegara appears to be waging\u00c20the classic international liberal crusade by fighting against mining, oil, and poaching, in the poor, permanently \u2018developing\u2019\u00c20countries like the Congo.

How did you find the conference?", "The conference was very high level, with high delegates from all over the world. The issue of Palestine is of course an intense issue. People were very passionate about the issue. There are a number of reasons why I came to Iran to attend this conference. One of them is that I wanted to understand Iran\u00e20\u0099elationship with Palestine and why the issue is such a strong issue. Now I feel like I have a better understanding of that.", "Now, after you\u2019ve visited Iran and attended the conference, how would you describe the relationship between Iran and Palestine?", "I understand the issue of Palestine very well myself. But I have a limited experience with Iranian politics aside from the surface level. So my understanding or my feeling before I came was that Iran\u00e20\u0099upport for the Palestine issue was more of a political connection, linked to support of Hezbollah and the Resistance. But what I have learned is more than this. It\u00e20\u0099ot so much strategic interest. It\u00e20\u0099ore of a justice, human rights and moral issue. I came to understand that; it was pretty clear. This is another dimension of understanding that I think is really important. So that was very valuable [to learn.]", "How effective do you think Iran\u00e20\u0099upport for Palestine has been?", "It\u00e20\u0099ifficult to measure. I would say there are two ways you can look at it. Some might view Iran\u00e20\u0099upport of Palestine as problematic; in that, you know people are very passionate about the issue, a very strong language is being used and it would seem to the Zionist regime and its allies that it would seem very aggressive rhetoric; they would translate it as a talk suggesting war. That\u00e20\u0099he potential negative perspective. On a positive perspective, if you look at how many Arab countries appear\u00e20\u0094me\u00e20\u0094be disinterested in the Palestinian issue. They may say they are with Palestine, but they\u00e20\u0099actions are not really there. The heartfelt support is no longer what it was before. And among countries that do support them, Lebanon has a hard situation because it\u00e20\u0099arrying the big burden of lots of refugees. So Lebanon is just surviving with the issue. Syria is under tremendous pressure right now with the war and that reduces its ability to be more of an advocate for Palestine right now. So the fact that Iran is so committed to supporting them, I think if Iran wasn\u00e20\u0099supporting Palestine], there wouldn\u00e20\u0099e anybody who would. I know Turkey has made a lot of big gestures in support and so forth, but then also Turkey is doing joint military exercises with the Israeli regime. That\u00e20\u0099ontradictory policy in a sense. I wouldn\u00e20\u0099uestion the sincerity of those in Turkey that support Palestine; I\u00e20\u0099ure they do it with all their heart. But in terms of the government maybe it doesn\u00e20\u0099ook so good if they\u00e20\u0099allowing the Zionist state to use their airbases to do airstrikes on Syria\u2013 which they did for at least once or twice that we know of. So Iran is the main person standing up for Palestine. I\u00e20\u0099ure that means a lot to Palestinians to know that at least somebody is really strongly supporting them and without that they might think that they\u00e20\u0099alone and desperate and who knows where that would lead. Not that the situation is improving any; it\u00e20\u0099etting worse in Palestine\u00e20\u0094arly. But at least some support is better than no support. So it\u00e20\u0099ard to measure if it\u00e20\u0099ffective or no. Maybe it is not positive in the plus sense, but I certainly do not think it\u00e20\u0099 negative thing although the proposed Jewish state\u00c20and the United States would say it\u00e20\u0099 negative thing to have Iran support the Palestine issue; which I think is unfair because the U.S. government don\u00e20\u0099cknowledge that the Palestinians are suffering. They don\u00e20\u0099ave any compassion at all. For them it\u00e20\u0099n easier political path to not support Palestine and to give full support to Israeli regime.

From Oslo right up until maybe a year or two ago, the two-state solution was still seen as some kind of viable option. However this year has been the first year in the US conversation that we are hearing talk of the one-state solution; which opens up the possibility of having a real debate about what is that one state going to look like, whereas before that was not happening. I\u00e20\u0099always argued that a two-state solution is a rip-off for the Palestinians because they still have no control over their water, electricity, airspace, the telecommunications, internet portal into the country, they don\u00e20\u0099ave a port, they don\u00e20\u0099ave the right to draw for the gas which is off the coast in Gaza\u00e20\u0094nty of gas. So they don\u00e20\u0099ave any means of supporting their country. Even if they did give them a state, it would not be much of a state. The US-backed Zionist regime would want to control the borders for \u00e20\u009curity reasons\u00e20\u009dt would never happen. The reason it would never happen is that if Palestine is ever recognized as a sovereign nation state, they would then have access to the international criminal court and they would sue Israel; there would be unlimited amount of suits and complaints or everything that has happened so far; unless Israel\u00c20negotiates that they have immunity and that\u00e20\u0099ot going to happen. So this idea of the two-state solution I don\u00e20\u0099hink it was ever possible in the first place; although people tried to pursue that solution, in reality I don\u00e20\u0099hink it was ever practical. At this conference I heard some of the Iranian leaders and delegations suggested that the one-state solution is really the way forward and I heard this from other people, too. Overall I think this is positive and Iran is leading this dialogue in a constructive way it would be good for their delegation on this issue.\u00c20 Hopefully there is a consensus by all parties that the first step might be a Palestinian referendum. \u00c20The referendum [suggested by Ayatollah Khamenei] is a good first step. Actually it\u00e20\u0099he necessary first step. In the \u00e20\u009cernational community\u00e20\u009dey talk about democracy, well, the referendum would be a first good step towards democracy.

All the media energy, all the focus, all the attention and diplomacy has been centered around Syria. This is very very bad for the Palestinians. The Zionist regime benefits from this automatically because the world is now looking at Syria and Israeli regime can get away with building new settlements while no one is going to take much notice. This is what they\u00e20\u0099done over the last many decades: when something is going on here, they start building over there, pushing in gradually into the occupied territories.

You take a city like Aleppo where over 1200 factories were dismantled; everything was taken out and moved Syria; so the whole manufacturing sector of Aleppo\u00e20\u0094ch was one of the Middle East\u00e20\u0099est industrial centers. About 90% has been dismantled in the last five years. That is by design. That was targeted for specific reason: to cripple the Syrian economy. So a lot of this heavy industry and machine equipment have been relocated or eluded into Turkey. Now Syria has lost its ability to export to Turkey, while they used to be trade partners. Now Syria has nothing enough to trade per se. Also oil has been stolen from Syria, has travelled via Iraqi Kurdistan back into Turkey and then for sale on the market. So illegitimate and illegal oil has been taken from Syria and sold on real markets in Turkey. So they\u00e20\u0099benefitted and gotten rich from this. Turkey has used the Syria conflict as well to project its military power. It has invaded Syria in two different locations. Presumingly they say it\u00e20\u0099o deal with the Kurdish YPG and so forth but in reality they weren\u00e20\u0099nvited to invade Syria, so this is a violation of the international law. In this new world we have certain countries that fall outside of the international law. We\u00e20\u0099always known that it\u00e20\u0099 selective international law enforcement but now it\u00e20\u0099eally bad. First the Zionist regime is always outside of the international law. You can have a hundred international resolutions to tell the Zionist regime to stop this and they don\u00e20\u0099ave to recognize any of them because the United States supports them. The U.S. is also outside of the international law by flooding illegal weapons, munitions and lethal items into Syria for the so-called \u00e20\u009cels\u00e20\u009dith the Persian Gulf states providing the cash for that. That\u00e20\u0099 conspiracy to destabilize a nation-state by arming terrorists which is against U.S. law as well as probably a number of international laws. So they\u00e20\u0099outside of the law. \u00c20You have a whole block of countries that are completely over outside of the international law. You can\u00e20\u0099eally have an international system like this. I think this has damaged the UN tremendously. You can add to that Saudi Arabia\u00e20\u0099ctivity in Yemen which is against all international laws in Geneva conventions. It\u00e20\u0099n undeclared war of aggression against your neighbor. That\u00e20\u0099he reason they created the UN in the first place, to deal with the Nuremberg trials. Saudi Arabia is doing what Germany did during the WWII, worse actually. Germany didn\u00e20\u0099arpet bomb Czechoslovakia or Poland; they invaded but they didn\u00e20\u0099ry to destroy their country. So in a way, Saudi Arabia is worse than pre- WWII Germany. The very thing that destroyed the nations\u00e20\u0099edibility would try to destroy the UN credibility. So there are lots of problems with Saudi Arabia and the UN. Qatar arguably might benefit from it in that by destabilizing Syria, the projected future gas pipeline from Iran through Iraq, to Syria to the Mediterranean is now off and it\u00e20\u0099ot going to happen. Because Qatar might think about a competing pipeline\u00e20\u0094ch is a Qatari gas pipeline\u00e20\u0094ough the same route. Therefore they would require a regime change in Syria and maybe break up Syria into a couple of different federal states in order to facilitate that in ten or fifteen years.", "Where do you think the situation in Syria is leading to? Which countries do you believe will come out of this as beneficiaries?", "In an indirect way, I believe that Russia has also benefitted from the war in the way that they\u00e20\u0099shown they\u00e20\u0099able to intervene in a conflict legally invited by the Syrian government and be effective in achieving military objectives whereas the U.S. has not been effective in achieving what they claim is their objective: to defeat ISIS. The U.S. air force has not managed to make any dent in Raqqa or any of the other places in Syria. All the \u00e20\u0098el\u00e20\u0099oups are using US weapons to some degree, munitions, bullets, TOW missiles\u00e20\u0094usands of TOW missiles have been supplied by the U.S. to the \u00e20\u0098erate rebels\u00e20\u0099ich aren\u00e20\u0099ery moderate. They\u00e20\u0099terrorists. US had benefitted in terms of weapons sales for the US defense contractors; they have done well out of it. Good for them and bad for Syria, bad for the people of Syria. Saudi Arabia, Qatar maybe appeared to have benefitted in that they\u00e20\u0099projecting their influence in hegemony in the Middle East over their borders. They thought that this would work and they would overthrow Damascus government but it hasn\u00e20\u0099appened. Aleppo was the turning point in seeing this wasn\u00e20\u0099oing to happen. So now it\u00e20\u0099ot a benefit for the GCC countries. It\u00e20\u0099ooking like a bad project that has ruined and destroyed a country and ruined the lives of many people. It helped fuel the migrant crisis into Europe. There are so many negatives.", "So do you believe Syria has turned into a debacle for the United States?", "Syria\u00e20\u0094me\u00e20\u0094a worst debacle for the U.S.; in fact worse than Iraq. In Iraq you knew what was coming. It was projected ahead of time and there was not much that could be done about it. Millions of people came out in the streets in the UK and Europe to protest that war but they just went ahead and did it anyway. In Syria it is more dangerous because what they\u00e20\u0099done is they fueled the radical extremist violent dangerous brand of terrorism and they\u00e20\u0099given them real battle field experiences and all these terrorists have learned basically how to destroy parts of countries. It\u00e20\u0099ust a terrible disaster. Perhaps they will move on to do this in different parts of the world. Even if they stopped in Syria they set up and create problems somewhere else. So this policy of backing armed insurgencies and terrorists in a country like Syria is a terrible practice. It\u00e20\u0099llegal based on US and international law. Every single politician who is involved in this should be on trial in my opinion; because they\u00e20\u0099done so much damage. I can\u00e20\u0099nderstand why this policy was undertaken. It\u00e20\u0099ust the most vicious, violent and terrible situation. We could lay that at the feet of Barak Obama. That\u00e20\u0099is legacy. How many lives have been lost? How many families, schools and hospitals have been ruined and destroyed in Syria? Property, businesses, history, heritage, it\u00e20\u0099ll destroyed. US, UK, France and everybody involved should be held responsible.
