The man has been identified as Thomas Finnigan, a white supremacist from Maryland. He has been taken into police custody, although currently Capitol Hill, including Congress and and the White House, remain on lockdown.",
            "When the attack was carried out, Finnigan was described by eyewitnesses as trying to leave the visitorÃ¢0\u0099enter, and advance further into either the library, Supreme Court, or even the White House.Ã¢0\u009c I heard was Ã¢0\u0098pletive removed] Obama!

He grew up in a lower class family in Tennessee, and later moved to Maryland. Not much else is known about the shooter.Ã¢0\u009cxe2\u00809s concerning, how some of our own born-and-bred American citizens are turning into terrorists over political unrest,Ã¢0\u009dC political analyst Ana Cuddy said. Ã¢0\u009cle in my own opinion, I must say I take no issue with the conservatives of the United States in general, this is not the first time a Donald Trump supporter specifically has carried out violent acts towards other members of the population. It is concerning to see how the Republican party has radicalized, and I hope the United States of America can learn its lesson from the treacherous acts Trump incites in our citizens.Ã¢0\u009d",

            "WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) â0\u0094llowing the results of Tuesday nightâ0\u0099lection, President Obama has signed Executive Order 13805, which orders a full recount of all votes cast in the election and calls for a special election to be held on December 19th. Obama signed the order in response to the concerns of thousands of voters across the country who said that they were prevented from casting a ballot on election day, too many absentee ballots have not been found or counted, equipment failures, as well as concerns that some members of the electoral college may have acted unethically.",
            "â0\u009cple all over the country have been flooding my office with calls, telling my staff of horror stories about being harassed and intimidated by poll workers,â0\u009dama told reporters. â0\u009cy have even said that they were flat out denied entry into the voting booths to cast their ballots if they were wearing a Hillary Clinton shirt or other signs showing support for her as President. This was especially bad in areas of Florida and North Carolina where there are high numbers of Latino and African American voters. We must investigate these claims. The margin of victory is too close to call, and the outcome of this election is too important. There is just too many legal challenges in too many states to just call this a victory for Trump.â0\u009d",
            "Under the Presidentâ0\u0099rder, the votes cast in all precincts nationwide will be recounted, and all poll workers who took part in Tuesdayâ0\u0099lection will be subjected to strict background checks. This process is expected to take 30 days. In precincts where the Department of Justice has cause to believe that voter suppression has occurred, new elections will be held on Dec. 19th, with those results being used to help determine who will represent the individual states in the electoral college.",

Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by more than 200,000 votes, but because of the electoral college, she still lost. That decision is reserved solely for the 538 electors who meet in their respective states on December 19th. What the people are actually voting for are their statesâ0\u0099ectors, not for the President. Though the system is odd and unfair, it has persisted because many insist that it works just fine as it is, with the winner of the popular and electoral vote usually matching. That does not mean, however, that it will continue to work just fine in the future. The way the system is set up could cause it to malfunction in some potentially terrifying ways, this recent election being one of them.â0\u009d",

Everyone should have an equal vote, and thatâ0\u0099ust not the case with the electoral college. You know what the electoral college gave us? It gave us George W. Bush. It gave us a war in Iraq, and the worst recession since the great depression. Itâ0\u0099ime to bring our system into the 21st century. I hope Obama fixes this, because president Trump is going to be a nightmare.â0\u009d",

Why wasn’t this news released earlier? How many votes were lost because of this?” Obama said. “If all of these questions cannot be answered by our deadline set in December, a recount will be ordered.”",

And honestly, I do not really believe if the election was HONEST to begin with, Hillary would have the popular vote. If we would take out the non citizen votes, the special pardons the Governor of Virginia did for 60,000 Felons, the over 1 million Military abroad that did not get their votes counted yet again because of Obama (2012 and 2016), and all the Soros owned electronic voting machines that switched Trump votes to Hillary…. plus look at Trump turn out at events and rallies vs Hillary turn outs !!! And let’s not forget the Swap My Vote website that allowed voters to pick Hillary, Jill, or Gary and pick someone on the site in another State that they could swap their vote with in order to strategically place a vote to help Hillary better !!!

We don’t need people like you and Melynda who are so ignorant and vile that they have not respect for the human race. You both are such frickin bigots; what you have to say is meaningless. Trump says he loves the uneducated and your spelling and language clearly puts you in that category – were Hillary’s speeches too advanced for you to understand. I know she didn’t speak at the 3rd grade level Trump uses. Is that his appeal?",
            "I just knew Obama & Hillary would try to pull some crap. If Obama is claiming Hillary got the most popular votes & wants a recount then we all should demand all of the 2,000,000 dead people’s votes & all of the illegal immigrants votes don’t count. Obama said in a video to an illegal immigrant who asked if she could vote that she was allowed to vote. California let millions of illegals vote. We have laws & the Constitution that say you must be a legal citizen to vote in our elections. What about all of the voting machines that changed the peoples votes? So many cities reported cheating & fraud. I bet if all of the Democrats cheating wasn’t done Trump would have also won more of the popular votes than reported. Having Obama interfere is like having the wolf watching the hen in the hen house. Impeachment is long overdue, he is the worse president America has ever had. He is dividing & destroying our country. The News Media suck too. Tell us the Truth!",
            "Who in their right mind would take Donald Trump serious?! His background alone is just unspeakable, his was of thinking is unreasonable. He has no respect for anyone or anything. Obama is not the problem. The problem is the millions of people who try and divide us, when in God’s eyes, we’re equal. Money is the root to evil (the love of it) and just as sure as today is Friday, having that ugh, man if that’s what you want to call him, as our president is just a slap in the face to our ancestors, those who believed and fought for the American dream, different races fighting for what’s right! Call him what you want, but my president is black and he’s well educated, and well raised. Who wants a First Lady that’s just another pop up girl? Who wants a president that disrespects women, children, veterans, hell everyone. Recount is an order!!#ImWithHer",

            "Donald Trump Protester Speaks Out: \"I Was Paid $3,500 To Protest Trump's Rally\" - ABC News",
            "“I was given $3,500 to protest Donald Trump’s rally in Fountain Hills,” said 38-year-old Paul Horner. “I answered a Craigslist ad about a group needing actors for a political event. I interviewed with them and got the part.”",
            "“As for who these people were affiliated with that interviewed me, my guess would be Hillary Clinton’s campaign,” Horner said. “The actual check I received after I was done with the job was from a group called ‘Women Are The Future’. After I was hired, they told me if anyone asked any questions about who I was with or communicated with me in any way, I should start talking about how great Bernie Sanders is.” Horner continued, “It was mostly women in their 60’s at the interview that I went to. Plus, all the people that I communicated with had an AOL email address. No one still has an AOL email address except people that would vote for Hillary Clinton.”",
            "A screenshot of the Craigslist ad that Horner says he responded to. The actual ad has since been removed. (Dennis System, File) / ABC News",
            "“I knew those weren’t real protesters, they were too organized and smart,” said 59-year-old Tom Downey, a Trump supporter who attended the rally in Fountain Hills. “I knew there was something up when they started shouting all these facts and nonsense like that. The best we could do was just yell and punch em’ and stuff.” Downey continued, “I think we did a good job though. I was shouting at them the whole time, calling them losers, telling them to get a job or go back home to mommy’s house; I got a bunch of high-fives from my fellow Trump supporters. It was a great time.”",
            "When asked about the other protesters at the rally, Horner said he saw most of them during the interview and training for the rally.",
            "“Almost all of the people I was protesting with I had seen at my interview and training class. At the rally, talking with some of them, I learned they only paid Latinos $500, Muslims $600 and African Americans $750. I don’t think they were looking for any Asians. Women and children were paid half of what the men got and illegals received $300 across the board. I think I was paid more than the other protesters because I was white and had taken classes in street fighting and boxing a few years back”",
            "Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she does not understand why Trump protesters would need to be paid.",
            "â0\u009cl protest that guy for free,” Bradley said. “Trump is creating a place for like-minded, ignorant, bigoted, hate-filled individuals to gather and unite. You wouldn’t have to pay me anything to protest that.” Bradley continued, “Trump supporters are the last kind of people to donate socks to the homeless, they only care about themselves and their white race. I would love the day I ever see a donation from a Trump supporter, I think it would make me change my opinion about them.â0\u009d",
            "Horner said the group had a mandatory six-hour training class that had to be completed before protesting at Trump’s rally.",
            "“During training we were taught chants to shout like ‘Dump Trump’ and ‘Trump Is A Racist’, things like that. We were told how to respond to anti-Trump comments too. If a Trump supporter said something about how great his wall will be, the Latinos in our group would say, ‘We’re just going to tunnel underneath it.’ They even gave me a shirt to wear at the rally which said ‘F*ck Donald Trump’ along with a sign to hold that said ‘Make America White Again’.”",
            "ABC News reached out to Hillary Clinton’s campaign for comment but did not receive a response. At the time of this posting, ads for the group were caring disclaimers which read, “At this time we are not accepting application for Muslims or persons who look of Middle Eastern descent.”",

Dr. Jimmy Rustling has won many awards for excellence in writing including fourteen Peabody awards and a handful of Pulitzer Prizes.

Dr. Rustling also spends 12-15 hours each day teaching their adopted 8-year-old Syrian refugee daughter how to read and write.",
            "There is such hatred and nasty words going on in the group called:”Obama is a Failure, so that makes me a Racist” THE SITE IS not FRIENDLY TO ANYONE WHO DOES not SUPPORT TRUMP…If a fact about his behavior or one of numerous lies is called out, the person commenting is called a troll and much worse…there are some gals on there that say how many love to hear from them…just pull up their wall and try to see friends “no friends” is what you get…my choice is Cruz for president…they even disregard Michael’s Savage recent accusation as lies by Trump…just try to discuss any political issue that is NOT favorable to Trump you are attacked.",
            "I spend way too much time on the political news feeds and can tellyou the Cruz supporters are as bad if not worse than the Trump supporters.BUT, I don’t think any of either group would get down in the gutter and disrupt a candidates political rally.",
            "“the Cruz supporters are as bad if not worse than the Trump supporters”",
            "I beg to differ, the difference is as night and day.Cruz supporters are up to debate while Trump supporters are closed minded and not up to debate.I know this because I have requested many times to debate the issues and not one single Trump supporter has done so yet.",
            "A Trump supporter added me to a pro Trump FB group when it’s more than obvious that I am a Cruz supporter being my profile photo is a photo of Ted Cruz with the flame in the corner. I’m not sure of his motive for doing so, many hoping to convert me to be a Trump supporter.",
            "I made a pro Ted Cruz comment, not an anti Trump comment and was immediately attacked for doing so. I was told that this is a Trump group and that I do not belong there and they requested the moderator to remove me from the group.",
            "I politely asked them questions in an attempt to engage them in a polite debate and was again attacked and called all sorts names while not a single person made an attempt of answering my questions. The reason they attack the messenger is because they are incapable of addressing the issues and defending their positions.",
            "I politely ask them to watch a video and they refused to watch it and again attacked and told me to leave the group. Below is the comment and video I requested them to watch.",
            "The very future of our nation hangs in the balance of this election. So many are totally unaware of the consequences if we fail to make the correct choice. There is only one option to preserve the future of our nation. We have one final chance to preserve our freedoms and the future of America if we choose wisely.",
            "If you love America and the freedom it provides and care about your future generations, your children and grandchildren and their children it would be well worth your while to watch this informative video that explains precisely why we must make the correct choice to preserve the very future of our nation for all future generations.",
            "Dan, you said “Let me count the ways” and then you didn’t mention a single one.Good for you! You’ve demonstrated an unwillingness to lie and distinguished yourself from the rabble of Alinskyite Trump-hate tools who obediently re-bleat “racist” about him, and other things for which there simply exists ZERO evidence. Your parents should be proud.",
            "It’s typical of Lie-berals: ask them to cite relevant facts, Constitutional authority, historical precedence, economic or natural law, sound reasoning,etc. to justify their diabolical, sinister policies/ philosophy. …crickets.",
            "Typical response from a libtard. Let’s see, dems fixed it so that hillary won not through hard work, or even deserving it, but via super delegates. I wonder if Bernie Sanders the irony to losing to Hilary Clinton after all his hard work…",
            "Hillary lies not just about the big stuff like the email scandals, lorretta meeting with bill Clinton etc. But also the tiny stuff in which she would have littl to gain. Her daughter wa jogging around the twin towers on 911? Landing under sniper fire in Ukraine? She is a compulsive liar.",
            "She pretends to the about women’s equality but silenced and insulted how many women who felt the advances etc from her sexual predator of a husband? And the following should set off alarm bells. Most women would ditch bill Clinton in that situation. Not hillary though, because she is nothing without clinton, an arranged power couple if you will. Imagine what she would let slide for personal gain as the president?",
            "Lastly she panders to the lgbtxyz, whilst her foundation takes in large sums of money from countries that like to toss them from roofs of buildings.",
            "You have to be a special kind of stupid, or if selfish individual (like hillary) to vote that traitor as president.",
            "You carry no leverage with your comments Ian Smith. Know why? You can’t talk to an opponent without using derogatory terms and name calling. Since you are so much smarter than the rest of us why aren’t you running for President??",
            "If you’re going to try to make it seem as though another person isn’t very smart, you should at least try to sound smart yourself. It is “more clever”….. not “clever-er”. I guess that makes you even less smart than you accuse her of being. Idiot.",
            "It has become SO obvious that this election is not about Liberals v. Conservatives v. RINOS v. LibertariansThis election is about Washington insiders, career politicians, special interests v. the rest of the U.S. Citizens.The more the Washington insiders, career politicians, special interests, and their Progressive pet media attack Trump , the more I know they are petrified that Trump will be the President to end their gravy train and corruption. You know what? I believe them.",
            "Actually, Trump has been an “insider” for years…he was the one paying off the politicians!!! Ted Cruz is the only “outsider”. He announced he would try to END all subsidies for ethanol (a huge Republican industry in IOWA) AND subsidies to OIL. He wants no more corporate welfare!!! No more kick backs to Congress and no more welfare from Congress (which comes from our tax money!)",
            "Stephen you hit on the nail.I don’t know where all this garbage started that Trump is a racist. Wanting to make people come to America legally is the way it should be.All of the politicians in congress and the senateForgot that they work for us the people.What have they done for you lately",
            "Punching an opponent is not the answer. This is just what the liberals want you to do and it will help them gain points. Please, next time you see a protester offer them a cup of coffee. Seriously. That will absolutely ruin their day!! To me that is so much more fun.",
            "Don’t worry; even if he gets the nomination, he won’t get elected. The fix is in, has been for years, and Hillary is going to be the next POTUS — unless something really surprising happens, like a landslide for Bernie.",
            "Frankly, I can give no worse indictment of the GOP than this: Donald Trump is the most honest and least racist of all but two of the candidates they put up. Carson was fairly honest and non-racist, but thunderingly ignorant. Rand Paul was likewise. All the rest were — and are — worse than Trump. Think about that.",
            "Well, you should be a huge fan considering you are obviously all three. You Liberal Scumbags always accuse as you do. Tell asswipe, have you taken a second to read his political platform? Or even the candidate you support. My best is your ignorant ass is the low information voter, Learning from five second sounds bytes, the Liberal Scum news and meme’s on meme’s on social media. the fact is your ignorant ass doesn’t know the first thing about Trump. remove head from ass. You won’t portray yourself as such an ignorant fool.",
            "I beg to differ! I am well educated and very well informed. I watch all the news shows, read, keep up with Twitter and FB, and not just about Trump. Apparently YOU are the one that is misinformed about Trump voters, sir.",
            "How many branches of our government hang in the balance of this election and just how great is the severity of this election? Are you aware that we only have one chance to make the correct choice for the very future of our nation and if we do not chose wisely we will lose our Constitutional rights and our freedom? This election could very well end this experiment in self governance we all know as America.",
            "The most likely scenario is that Trump is the one paying these guys to stir things up so he can pretend to be a tough guy. Trump supporters are obviously pretty stupid, so all they need is a focus for their hate and ignorance.",
            "Unfortunately many people do not like Mr. Trump. They are listening to the Establishment and are purposely given incorrect information. Establishment = Hillary, Ted Cruz, Soros, etc. all headed by Obama. The Establishment wants to do away with America’s citizens and stick with the candidates who give them what they want. Ted Cruz is one of them for example. Mr. Trump is not. He speaks the truth, although maybe not eloquently, but he does get his point across.",
            "George Soros is the money behind MoveOn.org, who is backing Bernie. Sue Perkins is a nurse with Nurse’s United, The Super Pac that supports Bernie That would explain why they were older women. Older women run that union",
            "“Unfortunately many people do not like Mr. Trump”The majority doesn’t, he only has about 38% max support which includes a lot of Dems that will vote for Hillary in the general election. They voted for Trump in the open primaries because he is the least likely to defeat Hillary. That’s why Trump did much better in open primaries than in closed primaries because the Hillary supporters voted for him in an attempt to make Trump the nominee being his the least likely to defeat his good friend Hillary.",
            "“They are listening to the Establishment and are purposely given incorrect information”As always. They will do or say anything to remain in power to protect their golden goose that lines their pockets with their crony capitalism. That’s how they become multimillionaires on a salary of only $174K per year and why they spend millions each election cycle to remain in power. They spend more to get into or remain in office than what the job pays. It would be a losing proposition if it weren’t for their crony capitalism. They’re not in it for us, they’re in it for them and them only and to hell with us that pays their salary.",
            "“Establishment = Hillary, Ted Cruz, Soros, etc. all headed by Obama”Hillary is definitely part of the establishment. Soros is the big money behind the scenes that finances the political game. He broke the Bank of England on Black Wednesday in September 1992 on the currency market and made over Â31 billion.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Wednesday",
            "I remember this well because I traded the commodities and currency markets in the 1990’s.",

            "Ted is a major threat to their golden goose crony capitalism and most fear prison time for their corruption. They will say or do anything to stay out of prison for their illegal deeds while in office.",
            "“Mr. Trump is not”He has a very long history of donating large sums of money to those in power for his own personal gain. He is part of the problem, not the solution to crony capitalism.",
            "“He speaks the truth”Trump is a liar and a fraud. He will say or do anything for his own personal gain. See above.",

            "I predict many demoncraps will ignore party lines and cast a vote for Trump as well. I think many people are actually Trump supporters that are actually in the closet.",

            "Actually, California was first settled by Spain, then became a part of Mexico, and was finally ceded to California in 1850.As for the Trump supporter story, I doubt it very much, just because there are Americans, including myself, who would be happy to peacefully protest this ignorant, hateful man, and all his followers. Do you really think he cares about you? Really? He doesn’t. He laughs at all of you while having drinks with Clinton. Sad really…you’re so taken in by his hyperbole (look it up).",

It’s an ugly thing.",

I worked hard to come to this country and provide for my family. I am an American. I took my naturalization test and proud to be an American! Take this country back from these freeloaders and everyone else that wants to destroy her. America has become a nanny state for immigrants. We have enough of our own problems within the country now to allow anymore people in it.",
            "The Mexicans were here before the â0\u009cte ahole ancestors?â0\u009dah right! You are such an uneducated idiot, go read some good history books. For your information the INDIANS were here before the colonizers but that ship has sailed; stronger people took possession of the land, it happens, it has happened all over the world since itâ0\u0099eginning, why donâ0\u0099ou put the whole human race under trial! Civilizations clash, they fight, some loose some win, deal with it. The Spaniards got south America and some island and managed to fuck them up and turn them into shitty places to live.

His plan to kill innocent families of terrorists who may have nothing to do with terrorism itself? His plan to censor all media that doesn’t agree with everything he says? Which of his extremist, fascist policies do you think will save the world? His shared ideology with Czar Vladimir Putin? I see nothing be fear, hatred, lies and death in everything he promises.",
            "You are the one that has no insight and remains too stupid and pc to understand the natural EVIl ways of these terrorists and their families.. We need a person like Trump bc everyone else has cow towed to these foreign countries and their taking advantage of us. Since when do u bow down to other countries? Once u do that ur an easy target and they have zero respect for us now and it will continue with someone that says “we need to build bridges’ ..FFS we’ve been building bridges for the last 8 years and the only thing that’s happening is that we’re watching them implode on our nation. Get real dude.",
            "Yup, JB Steel, I see fear, too. Lots of it in you, coupled with complete ignorance. Get the facts, will you. If you only knew the truth and listened with your own ears you would be able to point out how his words are taken out of context and sliced together to make almost a completely opposite statement. I realize I’m wasting my time because people like you want to repeat his quote, “women should be punished” in reference to abortion, to justify hating on him. Irrational, ignorant, misguided. The actual question from the interview was, “If abortion was illegal should women be punished for having them?” to which he answered, like any other law-abiding citizen would, that a law-breaker should be punished. Bank robbing is illegal, but not one gets excited if Donald Trump were to say bank robbers should be punished. The real issue is why is abortion illegal??? Making it illegal will take away choices and make criminals of those who seek to have them. It was a complete set up and he was being pushed to answer if someone breaks the law should they be punished.",
            "Well, if you are your photo, I can understand why. A spoiled young brat who thinks he should have everything given to him, never learned any history about this great country and doesn’t have a clue about common sense.

            "I’d guess it’s some Budweiser’d Trump supporters with a little too much cash at hand – folks who are doing this to give Trump’s pathetic little rallies some energy to work off. No other candidate would bother spending time or money on such silly displays.",
            "I knew there were paid protesters at Donald Trump rallies. Grow the hell up and let the process of election take place. Hillary would do anything not to face Trump if there the nominees for there perspective parties. It just shows you how low she will go to defeat Trump. TRUMP 2016",

The title alone screams Hillary supporters and possibly got !obey from her campaign. Not only is this shockingly disgusting to hire fake protesters but to specifically instruct them to say pro-Bernie stuff if questioned is DESPICABLE!",
            "Perhaps the Trump campaign is paying actors to protest at his owner rallies to work up the crowd. It wouldn’t surprise me. Or the campaign could be paying this guy tell this story to make the Clinton campaign look bad.",

Then fire another man for DOING his job & giving the go ahead to men who were watching this happen AND BEGGING YOU TO LET THEM HELP STOP HIS TORTURING!! Then how in the hell are we supposed to trust that you give a damn about us “civilians”????All she cares about is saving her own a$$ period!!At this point everyone just needs to face the fact that unless Cruz or Kesieck start to make some headway… Then the race is between Hillary or a Trump..and ill be dammed if I contribute to our next presedent being someone who would allow a man to be tortured to death after begging for help and her only replies consisted of ” check on my Lybian contracts” and gives orders to ” stand down”! Not after what I’ve seen. No way in hell!!!",

I do believe that someone is paying people to protest at Trump rally’s. I also believe it is childish and distracting. Maybe that is the point. Trump is winning the delegates and the other candidates are nervous. Why? Because he is going to put a stop to all the good ole boy mentallity in our government. Our current government works for themselves, not for us. If Hillary is elected it will be more of the same but she will lie about all of it. Do I want a woman in the White House? Yes I do!

            "I am extremely distressed at the responses I see in here. Almost everyone had to use a derogatory remark to the person they were responding to. You all seem to have forgotten this is still a free country and we have the right to choose our own candidate to vote for without fear of recrimination. I first got interested in politics when Kennedy and Nixon ran. What an amazing election that one was. I have been a Democrat, Independent and Republican. I have held political office. I really have reached the point where I no longer like or trust any Democrat or Republican who have chosen to make politics a career. Worst thing we have allowed to happen. Term limits were placed on the office of the President for a reason. The same reason should apply to all offices from the smallest town board to the White House. Reason?? Human beings are imperfect and their imperfections create the problems we have. We cannot live together peacefully. We are more easily motivated through anger than peace and love. We are not the only country that desires to make the rest of the world live as we do. Every type of government out there has the same desire. Every type of government feels it is the end all be all answer. Hence the competition world wide. Now a group from all over the world have come up with what they think is a solution. One world order. Everyone lives the same, does the same, and is the same. Imagine that!! What if everyone in your neighborhood had the same house, same income, ate the same meals, wore the same clothes, made exactly the same money. Is that what appeals to people??",
            "I am not saying this is the truth because I have no proof. However since Trump is getting a lot of unpaid publicity from things like this and based on the stated amounts of what people were paid it could be well within the realms of possibility that they were paid by neither Clinton supporters nor Sanders supporters but by a camp much closer to “home.” I do not hate Trump. I don’t believe he is what america needs however. We the people have been told for years that we need to just work hard get good jobs and we can get ahead. But I don’t see that happening. For one thing there are limited numbers of those so-called good jobs, then there is an increasing gap between those that have the good jobs and those that have minimum wage jobs.When Minimum wage was instituted the idea was that a man could work for 40 hours on said job support a wife and raise a family. Today we hear of people working 3 part time jobs (because the stores/etc refuse to hire for full time for 60-80 hours + and still having difficulty making ends meet for their families. It is easy to say just go get a job but the reality is that most if not all jobs have been slowly if not rapidly trickling out of the country to places like India, China, and even Mexico where the company needs not pay its workers even the minimum wage.My dad put 22 years in the service (Navy) and we still had struggles growing up with them raising 4 kids. Now I won’t say we were poor because we weren’t but we wore hand-me-down clothing and for a good part of the time when we got “new” clothes it was a donation from the parent of a classmate or it was from goodwill or some other thrift shop.My dad paid into a type of military insurance while he was in the service but even though he retired his death was found service connected. My mom was given a choice either take the VA benefits or take the insurance benefits and the VA ones were higher so that was the choice she made. Which means my dad and family was effectively robbed of the benefits he paid for. Yet I think he might have willingly paid for them anyway because what if his death had not been found service connected?Anyway back to the article. Who benefits most from the protesting? Well Horner is correct that if it can be implied or inferred it is Sanders supporters then this would be good propaganda for the Clinton campaign. However consider this Trump is a businessman and from things I have read he has had 4 failed businesses but he still seems to float up to the top at least appearance wise, so he is used to manipulating the media and propaganda to make himself look good. He thinks people are whiners and babies and people living in their parents house and that they are already being paid too much. the differences in the pay rates also seem to reflect much of his beliefs as well as to the value of the people hired. I too am college educated though I can’t say it helped me overly much to get a job. However I know that Trump is a shrewd business man in the sense that he knows how to work the angles. I however based on things he has said and the violence he seems to be provoking think that should he manage to be voted into power he would work to amend the constitution in such a way that the right to protest would be a thing of the past. And while all those that support him like the idea of building walls to keep people out do keep in mind that those same walls can keep people in as well.",
            "“When Minimum wage was instituted the idea was that a man could work for 40 hours on said job support a wife and raise a family.”",
            "Minimum wage was never meant to be a living wage. It was instituted so that businesses could not take advantage and pay next to nothing wages to young people out of school who wanted a summer job. It allowed young people to work for a decent wage and gain skills of working and being responsible. If you wanted to support a wife and family, you needed to acquire the skills and education to hold a job that paid such a wage, otherwise be happy flipping burgers and making milk shakes.",
            "Of course they were paid, they are 5th and 6th year acting or liberal arts “superseniors” who have no hope of a good job when they graduate.The skills in violence are a plus.His story reeks of the Corrupt Clintons, I’m surprised they didn’t look for some young women for the cadaverous looking Bill to “counsel” while he was in AZ.",
            "Yeah, Hillary Clinton supporters named their group “Women are the Future” and had a bunch of over-sixty women conduct interviews to hire fake protesters. Right. This sounds like a Republican maneuver to make it look like Bernie on the surface but Hillary if you do a little digging. If Hillary people backed this and wanted their involvement to remain secret, they would not use “Women are the Future.”",
            "Soooooooo it’s completely believable that these people were “paid” to protest but is unfathomable that Trump paid these people to say they were paid to protest? Can’t believe everything let alone everything u hear. Of course Trump supporters are going to bite all over this because they can’t believe that anyone would be personally willing to protest that buffoon of their own free will lol. Unbelievable",
            "It’s obviously the people that take things at face value that believe this article and support Trump. Trump has thrived off deliberately taking advantage of people who take things at face value. This is either a Trump supporter who wanted to add fuel to the false protestor fire or someone in the Trump campaign easily fooling his constituents to make them think only people who are paid will protest a Trump rally. But this is the truth. I would pay as much as I had to protest a Trump rally and I know of thousands of other people who would happily do the same. The guy is a disgrace to our country. His disingenuous demeanor and call for violence against non-supporters and minorities is disgusting to say the least. His mere presence has set us back.",
            "This sounds like a longer con to me. Any group that wanted to damage Trump’s campaign would have to have known that a tactic like this would be outed very quickly. Any organization willing to pay $3,500 for a protester at a rally would certainly have taken some steps to ensure that their actors didn’t talk afterwards.I imagine if you could trace this back, you’d be sure to find it’s connected to some group that sympathizes with Trump or maybe even the Trump campaign itself. It wouldn’t surprise me coming from the candidate who, at the start of his Presidential run was exposed for filling his rallies with paid shills.",
            "Soros, Hillary and anyone else involved in the hiring of protesters to fight and cause mahem should be arrested and tried for creating civil unrest by hiring people to cause chaos and public disruption which incites riots and murder of police officers and physical assaults upon innocent people just trying to hear what a Candidate has to say.

            "WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) â0\u0094rly this morning, President Obama made what could very well prove to be the most controversial move of his presidency with the signing of Executive Order 14302, which makes it illegal to perform the national anthem at sporting events nationwide. Under the new order, it is now illegal to perform or recite the national anthem in any public venue. Because the anthem is primarily performed before sporting events, this is where the new order will have its biggest impact. Individuals who violate this order can face fines of up to 5,000 dollars and up to one year in federal prison.",
            "The president said that his decision is a show of solidarity with the athletes who have been taking a knee during the anthem to protest police brutality.

            "â0\u009cthe recent protests by athletes like San Francisco 49ers Quarterback Colin Kaepernick have taught us anything, itâ0\u0099hat the anthem is far too violent and far too polarizing to have any place in the national discourse. Our nation is being torn apart by a song, a song that is outdated and, jingoistic. Without swift action, we cannot move forward as a nation; we cannot heal the wounds of racial division. How can we expect our police officers to stop killing African Americans when the very song of our nation is one that glorifies killing?â0\u009d",

            "Fireman Suspended & Jailed By Atheist Mayor For Praying At Scene Of Fire - ABC News",
            "DEQUINCY, LA (AP) â0\u0094rly this morning, a small town in Louisiana suspended one of its firefighters, 39-year-old Ronnie Edwards, without pay for praying while on duty at the scene of a fire. Edwards, who has been with the DeQuincy Fire Department since he was 21, was also arrested and sentenced to 30 days in jail.",
            "“I just do what our Lord & Savior, Jesus Christ, would do,” Edwards told local DeQuincy news station DQLA6. “It’s not about me, it’s about spreading his message, you know? He works through me, I’m just fortunate enough to be part of that.”",
            "According to sources within the DeQuincy Fire Department, Edwards, known to locals as “The Praying Fireman”, has been praying at the scene of fires since he joined the department in 1998, and it is only recently that the ritual has become an issue.",
            "“Ronnie [Edwards] would always pray after we put out a fire, most of the time in the front yard or something,” fellow firefighter Eugene Ketchum said. “It never really bothered anyone, it was just something he did. We put our lives on the line whenever we respond to a fire. I figure if praying helps him out then why not let the guy pray?â0\u009d",
            "Ketchum said that things changed in 2014 when DeQuincy elected the first democratic mayor in its history, an African American atheist named Lawana Jones. He said that when Jones heard that Edwards made a habit of praying at fires she sent a memo to all city employees advising them that any expression of personal religious belief while on duty was a violation of their contract with the city.",
            "According to DeQuincy city attorney Paul Horner, Jones made four previous attempts to address the issue personally with Edwards, but Edwards became more defiant with each meeting.",
            "“Refusal to obey an official city order is a misdemeanor and we must take action to address the crime,” Horner told reporters. “We didnâ0\u0099ant to suspend the man and have him arrested but we were out of options.â0\u009d",
            "Mayor Jones, spoke with ABC News, about her decision to suspend and imprison Edwards for praying while at work.",
            "â0\u009ce2\u00809m not anti-religious,â0\u009did Mayor Jones in a written statement, â0\u009c there is an appropriate time and place for everything. When he prays while on duty, he gives the impression that the City of DeQuincy is endorsing one particular religion over another. That is not the message that my office wants to send; itâ0\u0099ot what the people of DeQuincy elected me to do.â0\u009dnes continued, “If you live in a county where democracy is established, you should be aware that the idea of the separation of church and state is the only way to prevent the government from forcing religion on you and directing your religion and its doctrines. Religion is one of the most important factors in most peopleâ0\u0099ives and it should be treated with reverence. In order to keep the government from directing religion and making it change how you are allowed to believe, church and state need to be separate. This allows for more openness when it comes to the decisions of the country. And in a world where everyone has different beliefs and different religions, a forced religion can cause an uprising and the dissolvent of a nation. You’re supposed to do your job, not involve politics and religion into it.”",
            "ACLU spokesperson Cassandra Schmidt told ABC News the organization supports Mayor Jonesâ0\u0099evotion to the separation of church and state” and said that the ACLU would cover 100% of the cityâ0\u0099egal fees should Mr. Edwards try and sue the city.",
            "Jones won the office after promising to fix the cityâ0\u0099ledgling schools and bring new economic opportunity to the area. In that time, she has brought in over 300 good paying jobs, which has enabled her to increase city funding to the DeQuincy school district by 32%. DeQuincyâ0\u0099est scores have also already shown significant improvement.",
            "Still, many in the town are wondering if what they have gained is worth what they have lost.",
            "“My brother wasnâ0\u0099urtinâ0\u0099body,” Edwardsâ0\u00990-year-old sister Tami Hobart said. â0\u009ct people in DeQuincy is Christian, and I think we all took comfort in knowing that his heart was right with the Lord before he risked his life. It feels like we sold our souls to get that cat food factory and them fancy new textbooks.â0\u009d",
            "Republican Presidential Nominee, Donald Trump, caught wind of Edward’s misfortune and while speaking to Fox News offered some harsh words for Mayor Jones.",
            "â0\u009can tell you; when I win the White House, thereâ0\u0099onna be changes in DeQuincy. Theyâ0\u0099gonna reinstate Ronnie Edwards, theyâ0\u0099gonna give him his back pay, theyâ0\u0099gonna give him restitution for the time he spent in jail, and Lawana Jones is going to pay for it. And if Mayor Jones doesnâ0\u0099ant to do that, Iâ0\u0099have her thrown in jail so fast her head will spin.â0\u009d",
            "In spite of all that has happened, Edwards says that he is not bitter.",
            "â0\u009c Bible says that there will be sacrifices when you choose to follow the path of righteousness; it says that you will be reviled by the wicked. I will continue to pray that Mayor Jones comes to accept Jesus Christ, and will keep praying that God sees fit to put Donald Trump in the White House, but whether or not any of that happens, I still trust God and know that everything is happening according to his divine plan.â0\u009d",
            "Edwards is scheduled to begin serving his 30-day jail sentence at the DeQuincy City Jail on November 5th, the same day as Paul Horner’s birthday. Edwards told ABC News that he encourages, “Those wishing to support his cause, to support a charity that gives news socks to the homeless, called Sock It Forward.”",
            "If you have any questions regarding the case, you can contact the DeQuincy City Attorneyâ0\u0099ffice at (785) 273-0325.",

Dr. Rustling also spends 12-15 hours each day teaching their adopted 8-year-old Syrian refugee daughter how to read and write.",
            "Think of the bight side! When the MAN comes around, He’s gonna’ send that SOB straight to hell. Mr. Edwards, I remember when people like you were common place. Believe it or not, but when I was growing up people use to pray at school, they prayed at work, they prayed before ball games, they even prayed before eating meals. Do what you do and suffer the consequences, because they’re nothing compared to Mayor Jones’ consequences:And I heard, as it were, the noise of thunderOne of the four beasts saying,,‘Come and see.’ and I saw,AND I HEARD A VOICE IN THE MIDST OF THE FOUR BEAST AND I LOOKED AND BEHOLD, A PALE HORSE IT’S NAME IT SAID ON HIM WAS DEATH AND HELL FOLLOWED WITH HIM!!!",
            "You sir are exactly what is wrong with this country. We were founded on Church & State being basically the same thing and that is what has made us the greatest nation in the world. As this type of thing continues and is allowed to continue, we will continue to see our nation crumble.",
            "Why do you assume that he would not be concerned about a Muslim prayer? Why on earth would an atheist not have the same opinion about both prayers?Your assumption simply makes zero sense.Of course he would be as concerned. A prayer to one imaginary being is no different than the other imaginary being.You know I see this kind of stupid comment a lot and have to assume the author of this kind of comment must be some special kind of idiot to think that.",
            "@SecularYakking, with your name calling comment I see your liberal ways are in high gear. First off, the Mayor is a she, secondly I’m sure she wouldn’t say a word. Why? Because some people have become too scared to say anything to the Muslim religion for fear of being called a bigot, racist, islamiphobist etc, and being punished by our corrupt federal govt. Didn’t you get the memo? It’s ok to express your beliefs and opinions, as long as you’re not a white, pro 2nd Amendment, God fearing Christian with conservative values. Her tactics are completely asinine, if he wants to pray, or any person for that matter regardless of their religion, let them pray. I may not agree with their beliefs, but this is a free country……for now.",
            "Sorry Michael that you are so brain dead. You dont know your own countries history. Some people dont like using a spoon so does that mean if someone sees you using a spoon rather than a fork while at lunch working for the city…they should be arrested for their personal taste? Its ignorant morons like you who dont have clue to what the real issues are and how important a part they played in the founding of the greatest nation in history. This act by this fool mayor has nothing to do with religion or religious rights but a political agenda which if continues will destroy the very freedoms you now enjoy by being able to post your foolish thoughts.",
            "You couldn’t be more wrong. Separation of church and state was to keep government out of religion, not religion out of government. God reigns supreme and His presence is everywhere! I won’t deny others their religious preferences, but how dare anyone deny mine… this is the freedom many Americans have fought and died to protect… this is America!!!",
            "First off there is NOTHING in the constitution that says separation of church and state that is a modern false notion that people have iinterpreted the founding fathers to mean. For those that doubt what the founding fathers meant let me direct your attention that at the time they came to this country, before it was even a country, the religion of England was the Church of England. which is Angelican. They wanted the freedom to go to the church of their choice and practice how they believed without being told which church they HAD to go to So when our constitution says that Congress shall make no law establishing religion they meant that Congress should not declare a particular religion to be the official religion of the United States. Second of all the mayor in this case has violated the firefighters constitutional rights. Not only of the United States constitution also that of the State of Louisana. Because of the violations of the firefighters rights, I would urge everyone to call the town and complain. Make their phone system go nuts with calls complaining about this as well as fill the inboxes of the major and their legal department with emails regarding this as well. I sincerely hope that the ACLJ gets involved with this case to support the firefighter.",
            "This has absolutely nothing to do with the separation of Church and State which leftist Dems have a convoluted understanding of. The fire Dept was not establishing any religion whatsoever. I garauntee you if the firefighter was waving crystals and chanting ineligible words, nothing would be said. The Mayor is lying through her teeth if she’s saying that she respects the right for people to be religious, but there’s there’s a time and place for that. Well tell that to a Muslim who works for the city and see how far that goes. She would back off like the cowardly lion in front of the Oz! Atheism is a religion wether she wishes to believe it or not. So from here on out, you can kiss this cities prosperity good bye!",
            "The separation of church and state means there will not be a State Religion. We fled from England and the Church of England to find freedom. It has nothing to do with a firefighter praying at a fire scene.",
            "Nowhere in the Constitution is there any mention of separation of church and state. That is a fabrication made by ignorant people in their attempt to garner control. Read the first amendment. The reason it was written that way is because they didn’t want another Church of England over here. Being free to worship God in the way you see fit is the cornerstone of that part of the amendment and the Mayor, in her zeal, violates to the core, that (part of the) amendment’s very purpose. What she did was shove her beliefs down Firefighter Edward’s throat. Now, what was that about separation of church and state? She worships at the alter of Lawana Jones.",
            "A fabrication made by Thomas Jefferson and upheld by several supreme court cases.You know what else isn’t mentioned directly in the Constitution?The Air ForceCongressional DistrictsThe Electoral CollegeExecutive OrderExecutive PrivilegeFreedom of Expression(Absolute) Freedom of Speech and Press“From each according to his ability…”GodImmigrationImpeachment means removal from officeInnocent until proven guiltyIt’s a free countryJudicial ReviewJury of Peers“Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness”MarriageMartial LawNo taxation without representationNumber of Justices in the Supreme Court“Of the people, by the people, for the people”Paper MoneyPolitical PartiesPrimary ElectionsQualifications for JudgesThe right to privacyThe right to travelThe right to voteYet all of these are currently held as constitutional. Funny thing, the interpretation of the Constitution gives us these rights,but you want to ignore one just because you don’t agree with it.",
            "Your point is? Are you aware that you can do a job and pray at the same time. He didn’t leave to go to the nearest church. This is nothing more but a bully mayor, (I knew before I even read the mayor’s gender, that it was a woman. ) BTW: Separation of church and state is not in the constitution, and it actually meant that the STATE CAN’T FORCE THEIR RELIGION ON PEOPLE, NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND…",
            "He waited till they were ready to leave the site. As a christian I am tired of those that allow the freedom of speech to cover those that will offend me such as sitting during the National Anthem but persecute someone that may offend them. They are both exercising their right to free speech.He is working at the time but everyone gets a break according to Labor laws. Kaepernick is also in uniform, at work, and exercising his right to free speech and he is being defended and made a poster boy for freedom of speech. I see no difference between the two.",
            "I am ashamed to be called a Louisianian . This mayor has used her position to gain attention for herself. Since there have been no complaints by the people whom he prayed for then why try to buy in to the media attention, Mayor. If you don’t belive there is a God and we are all fools then what are you so scared of? Yeah you know that there is. Even the demons believed. And you are scared of God’s power. Hope and pray that God will allow me to see your face the day after the rapture!",
            "How can something be all right for 240 years, but suddenly, in year 241, a town elects a person to be mayor who objects to that action and boom! That action is no longer acceptable. Says who? The majority of the people in our nation don’t agree with with garbage like what this woman is pulling. As stated above, the first amendment is written to keep the state out of the church. That principle has been sorely violated in the latter part of last century and continuing into this one. Conclusion: the fireman was completely within his rights. His rights have been violated. I wonder if the Alliance Defending Freedom would be interested in getting involved.",
            "Dequincy needs to start a recall petition today. The voters got her in office and now need to get her out of office. One major problem with our nation s we have taken God out of our schools, laws, supreme court, etc. We have to reverse the trend and put God first in our lives. We have freedom of religion and if a fireman wants to pray he should be able to anywhere.",

            "That fireman does not represent the entire state or county when he prays at these fires. If someone has a problem with it then so be it. Get over it and mind your own business. Maybe you wouldnâ0\u0099e so miserable if you worried as much about yourself as much as you worry about what everyone else is doing. If you donâ0\u0099elieve in God or like that a person is worshiping God, then get out there next to him and worship whatever being or Satan that you believe in rather than condemning him for his beliefs. I could care less what anyone else is doing as long as it is not jeopardizing my safety or someone elses. You are never going to be able to make everyone happy; therefore, the state is being discriminatory, against whom ever is not happy. At some point, people need to just stop. How about I say, I donâ0\u0099ike your hair cut, or the clothes you wear, then the Government steps in and makes a law that you have to have your hair cut a certain way or wear certain clothes. It is never ending. The Government should be more worried about perfecting the existing criminal laws rather than making stupid laws about personal preferences to religion because some idiot wants to whine and cry about it. I am just so sick of all of these adults out there acting like they are 5 years old fighting over who has what toy. Small children have an excuse to act like that, but adults do not. Maybe they should fire the person who complained about him praying because they obviously donâ0\u0099ave enough to do if they have that much time to whine or make a formal complaint.",
            "What a difference..then and now. Then, during WWII for ex. we as a Nation prayed. There are pictures of the soldiers and their liders, praying in the battle field. We won that war, THANKS TO GOD! Instead, we began to think we won because of our strength and the weapons! The proof that prayer is the key to our strength, is how we grew stronger than the rest of the world! Today we are relying ourselves on whom?!

The exception to the rule is when you have a state or government job, your religion stays at the door with these jobs.
