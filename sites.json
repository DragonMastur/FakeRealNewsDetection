I interviewed with them and got the part.\u201d", "\u201cAs for who these people were affiliated with that interviewed me, my guess would be Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign,\u201d Horner said. \u201cThe actual check I received after I was done with the job was from a group called \u2018Women Are The Future\u2019. After I was hired, they told me if anyone asked any questions about who I was with or communicated with me in any way, I should start talking about how great Bernie Sanders is.\u201d Horner continued, \u201cIt was mostly women in their 60\u2019s at the interview that I went to. Plus, all the people that I communicated with had an AOL email address. No one still has an AOL email address except people that would vote for Hillary Clinton.\u201d", "A screenshot of the Craigslist ad that Horner says he responded to. The actual ad has since been removed. (Dennis System, File) / ABC News", "\u201cI knew those weren\u2019t real protesters, they were too organized and smart,\u201d said 59-year-old Tom Downey, a Trump supporter who attended the rally in Fountain Hills. \u201cI knew there was something up when they started shouting all these facts and nonsense like that. The best we could do was just yell and punch em\u2019 and stuff.\u201d Downey continued, \u201cI think we did a good job though. I was shouting at them the whole time, calling them losers, telling them to get a job or go back home to mommy\u2019s house; I got a bunch of high-fives from my fellow Trump supporters. It was a great time.\u201d", "When asked about the other protesters at the rally, Horner said he saw most of them during the interview and training for the rally.", "\u201cAlmost all of the people I was protesting with I had seen at my interview and training class. At the rally, talking with some of them, I learned they only paid Latinos $500, Muslims $600 and African Americans $750. I don\u2019t think they were looking for any Asians. Women and children were paid half of what the men got and illegals received $300 across the board. I think I was paid more than the other protesters because I was white and had taken classes in street fighting and boxing a few years back\u201d", "Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she does not understand why Trump protesters would need to be paid.", "\u00e20\u009cl protest that guy for free,\u201d Bradley said. \u201cTrump is creating a place for like-minded, ignorant, bigoted, hate-filled individuals to gather and unite. You wouldn\u2019t have to pay me anything to protest that.\u201d Bradley continued, \u201cTrump supporters are the last kind of people to donate socks to the homeless, they only care about themselves and their white race. I would love the day I ever see a donation from a Trump supporter, I think it would make me change my opinion about them.\u00e20\u009d", "Horner said the group had a mandatory six-hour training class that had to be completed before protesting at Trump\u2019s rally.", "\u201cDuring training we were taught chants to shout like \u2018Dump Trump\u2019 and \u2018Trump Is A Racist\u2019, things like that. We were told how to respond to anti-Trump comments too. If a Trump supporter said something about how great his wall will be, the Latinos in our group would say, \u2018We\u2019re just going to tunnel underneath it.\u2019 They even gave me a shirt to wear at the rally which said \u2018F*ck Donald Trump\u2019 along with a sign to hold that said \u2018Make America White Again\u2019.\u201d", "ABC News reached out to Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign for comment but did not receive a response.

What if everyone in your neighborhood had the same house, same income, ate the same meals, wore the same clothes, made exactly the same money. Is that what appeals to people??", "I am not saying this is the truth because I have no proof. However since Trump is getting a lot of unpaid publicity from things like this and based on the stated amounts of what people were paid it could be well within the realms of possibility that they were paid by neither Clinton supporters nor Sanders supporters but by a camp much closer to \u201chome.\u201d I do not hate Trump. I don\u2019t believe he is what america needs however. We the people have been told for years that we need to just work hard get good jobs and we can get ahead. But I don\u2019t see that happening. For one thing there are limited numbers of those so-called good jobs, then there is an increasing gap between those that have the good jobs and those that have minimum wage jobs.When Minimum wage was instituted the idea was that a man could work for 40 hours on said job support a wife and raise a family. Today we hear of people working 3 part time jobs (because the stores/etc refuse to hire for full time for 60-80 hours + and still having difficulty making ends meet for their families. It is easy to say just go get a job but the reality is that most if not all jobs have been slowly if not rapidly trickling out of the country to places like India, China, and even Mexico where the company needs not pay its workers even the minimum wage.My dad put 22 years in the service (Navy) and we still had struggles growing up with them raising 4 kids. Now I won\u2019t say we were poor because we weren\u2019t but we wore hand-me-down clothing and for a good part of the time when we got \u201cnew\u201d clothes it was a donation from the parent of a classmate or it was from goodwill or some other thrift shop.My dad paid into a type of military insurance while he was in the service but even though he retired his death was found service connected. My mom was given a choice either take the VA benefits or take the insurance benefits and the VA ones were higher so that was the choice she made. Which means my dad and family was effectively robbed of the benefits he paid for. Yet I think he might have willingly paid for them anyway because what if his death had not been found service connected?Anyway back to the article. Who benefits most from the protesting? Well Horner is correct that if it can be implied or inferred it is Sanders supporters then this would be good propaganda for the Clinton campaign. However consider this Trump is a businessman and from things I have read he has had 4 failed businesses but he still seems to float up to the top at least appearance wise, so he is used to manipulating the media and propaganda to make himself look good. He thinks people are whiners and babies and people living in their parents house and that they are already being paid too much. the differences in the pay rates also seem to reflect much of his beliefs as well as to the value of the people hired. I too am college educated though I can\u2019t say it helped me overly much to get a job. However I know that Trump is a shrewd business man in the sense that he knows how to work the angles. I however based on things he has said and the violence he seems to be provoking think that should he manage to be voted into power he would work to amend the constitution in such a way that the right to protest would be a thing of the past. And while all those that support him like the idea of building walls to keep people out do keep in mind that those same walls can keep people in as well.", "\u201cWhen Minimum wage was instituted the idea was that a man could work for 40 hours on said job support a wife and raise a family.\u201d", "Minimum wage was never meant to be a living wage. It was instituted so that businesses could not take advantage and pay next to nothing wages to young people out of school who wanted a summer job.

Trump has thrived off deliberately taking advantage of people who take things at face value. This is either a Trump supporter who wanted to add fuel to the false protestor fire or someone in the Trump campaign easily fooling his constituents to make them think only people who are paid will protest a Trump rally. But this is the truth. I would pay as much as I had to protest a Trump rally and I know of thousands of other people who would happily do the same. The guy is a disgrace to our country.

They wanted the freedom to go to the church of their choice and practice how they believed without being told which church they HAD to go to So when our constitution says that Congress shall make no law establishing religion they meant that Congress should not declare a particular religion to be the official religion of the United States. Second of all the mayor in this case has violated the firefighters constitutional rights. Not only of the United States constitution also that of the State of Louisana. Because of the violations of the firefighters rights, I would urge everyone to call the town and complain.
