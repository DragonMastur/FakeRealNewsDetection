                "When the attack was carried out, Finnigan was described by eyewitnesses as trying to leave the visitorÃ¢0\u0099enter, and advance further into either the library, Supreme Court, or even the White House.Ã¢0\u009c I heard was Ã¢0\u0098pletive removed] Obama!

Ã¢0\u009cle in my own opinion, I must say I take no issue with the conservatives of the United States in general, this is not the first time a Donald Trump supporter specifically has carried out violent acts towards other members of the population. It is concerning to see how the Republican party has radicalized, and I hope the United States of America can learn its lesson from the treacherous acts Trump incites in our citizens.Ã¢0\u009d",
